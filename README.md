FizzBuzz-CSharp
===============

FizzBuzz in C# - With a semi-functional programming style, optimized for readability

original problem is stated as such:

>Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

C# has changed quite a bit in it's last couple iterations.  The addition of LINQ and extension methods have allowed the language to become much more expressive.  This isn't the best or most efficient implementation of FizzBuzz, it's even a bit over-engineered. But the intent is to display style and opinion.  

I believe the most important aspects of code quality are 

	1) It works.
	2) It can easily be read by the next developer 
		(see the aphorism: "Everyone else's code sucks, in 3 weeks your code becomes everyone elses")

I say they are the most important because any other performance, security, naming, etc concerns can be addressed after the fact if the code shows clear intent in what it's doing.  Especially if you have the safety net of tests.
